function [template,ir_reference]=casptemplate(target,reference,modelname,modelpars)
%CASPTEMPLATE  Generate a template for the optimal detector
%
%  CASPTEMPLATE(target,reference,modelname,modelpars) generates the template
%  needed for the optimal detector. CASPTEMPLATE will run the model
%  specifief by modelname on the signals stored in target and reference
%  and generate the template from this.
%
%  If target or reference is a matrix, each column will be considered a
%  signal, and averaging will be done. This is usefull for stochastic
%  signals.
