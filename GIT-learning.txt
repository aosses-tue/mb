If you forgot to commit files while working in other computer... 

In 'Ubuntu-pc'
	Commit the changes from 'ubuntu-PC'
In 'Win7-pc'
	git pull
In case git pull failes, that means you have edited some of the late committed files from ubuntu then:
	Create a back-up of the updated doc in 'Win7-pc' (copy-paste)
	type: 'git checkout -- Psychoacoustics/hz2bark.m'
	type: 'git pull'
	Apply again the changes manually from the copy-pasted document into the just updated document from the repository
VIM:
	- To close window press ESC (make sure we are out of edition mode) then type in the command line :wq
